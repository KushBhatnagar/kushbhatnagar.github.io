Hello, my name is Kush Bhatnagar, and I am an engineer who strongly values **continuous learning, writing, and simplicity**.

I believe that **learning** is a continuous loop, and in order to truly learn something, we must constantly experiment and transform our knowledge. Here's an explanation in pictures.

**Writing** is one of the most powerful but often underrated skills that humans have developed. It empowers us to express ourselves and articulate complex topics in a concise and effective manner.

We know **simplicity** reduces complexity. With this blog series, I am taking on the challenge of exploring complex subjects and transforming my learnings into simple and digestible concepts for my readers.
