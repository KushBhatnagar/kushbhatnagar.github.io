Hello, if you are here, I assume you are interested in knowing who I am and why I started this blog series. As an engineer, I value **writing, learning, and simplicity**. 

**Writing** is one of the most powerful but often underrated skills that humans have developed. It empowers us to express ourselves and articulate complex topics in a concise and effective manner.

I believe that **learning** is a continuous loop, and in order to truly learn something, we must constantly experiment and transform our knowledge. The below picture can explain it better.

**Simplicity** is the quality of being easy to understand or do without unnecessary complications or elaboration to minimize complexity.


Through the combination of these three skills, great potential can be unlocked.  My goal with this blog series is to provide my readers with digestible concepts based on my learning of complex topics. I'll write about Machine Learning, MLOPs, Data-Centric applications, Cloud, and more. Sometimes I will discuss certain books, provide insight about why I chose that book, and share a learning experience.
