## My reasons

**Atomic Habits** by James Clear is a New York Times bestsellers. This famous book caught my attention during the pandemic. It was becoming increasingly difficult for me to balance my professional and personal work during this time. While I am not a fan of 'self-help' books, I really want to improve my daily routine, so I want to give this book a try. Honestly, I am still far from having an ideal routine, but after reading this book, I know my strengths and areas for improvement, and I have clarity about where I need to improve. Additionally, I was caught by the tagline 

> **Tiny changes, remarkable results**

How can small changes in our routine impact our long-term goals? In order to understand these things, I chose the book.

There are a few additional insights and takeaways from "Atomic Habits" that you may find useful:

1. The importance of identity-based habits: Clear argues that our habits are often a reflection of our identity. In other words, if we want to change our habits, we need to change our sense of self. He suggests focusing on small identity-based habits that reinforce the type of person you want to be. For example, instead of saying "I want to lose weight," say "I am the type of person who makes healthy choices."

2. The role of environment in habit formation: Clear emphasizes that our environment plays a crucial role in shaping our habits. He suggests designing your environment to make good habits more visible and bad habits less visible. For example, if you want to eat healthier, keep healthy snacks on your desk and remove junk food from your pantry.

3. The power of habits in achieving long-term goals: Clear argues that success is often the result of small, daily habits that add up over time. He encourages readers to focus on the process of habit formation, rather than the outcome. By making small, consistent changes to our habits, we can achieve long-term goals and sustain our progress over time.

4. The importance of flexibility and adaptation: Clear acknowledges that life is unpredictable and that we will inevitably face setbacks and obstacles in our habit formation journey. He suggests embracing a growth mindset and being willing to adapt and adjust our habits as needed. This means being flexible and open to trying new strategies and approaches.
