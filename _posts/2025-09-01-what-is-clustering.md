excerpt: "Just wrapped up my latest ML comic on Clustering - where data points find their natural friend groups! After exploring how models balance complexity (Regularization) and navigate the learning sweet spot (Bias-Variance), this one shows how algorithms can discover hidden patterns without being told what to look for.\n\nSwipe through the comic below to see how Teacher breaks down this unsupervised learning magic to Student - spoiler alert: it involves a fun analogy that'll make clustering click instantly!"
