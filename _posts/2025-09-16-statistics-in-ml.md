excerpt: "Think of Statistics as the "mathematics of chai-making" - you need to know the right proportions of milk, water, sugar, and tea leaves to make the perfect cup, right? Similarly, Machine Learning without Statistics is like trying to make chai blindfolded - you might get lucky once, but you won't know why it worked or how to repeat it!

Statistics is literally the backbone of ML. When Netflix recommends "Sacred Games" after you watched "Mirzapur," it's using statistical patterns from millions of users. When your phone's autocorrect knows you meant "biryani" not "biriyani," that's statistics at work! It helps ML understand patterns, make predictions, and most importantly, tell us how confident we are about those predictions."
